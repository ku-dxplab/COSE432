 Important Parents do not go there with your children They are not welcome After a long trip from Germany late in the evening we were welcomed with rude and arrogant behavior at the reception We were with our son and we were forced to pay additional room for him This is the first time we received such kind of humiliating behavior nevermind of the type of the hotel There were no manager at duty and we didn t received any help Of course we didn t stay at this hotel but we were charged for it I am not about the 100 EUR but this type of humiliating behavior is absolutely not acceptable , Bulgaria ,2.5,0,0,Family

 Room was very disappointing have booked studio rooms at other Park Plaza hotels for family trips and been really impressed Not at all sure what qualifies this room as a studio it was smaller than a family room in a more budget hotel and the only divided area was in essence a vestibule with a desk in it The bathroom was very shabby the door wouldn t close , United Kingdom ,5.0,0,0,Family
 The Hotel is really overpriced It is not a 4 star hotel The room smells of dirty the carpet was full of spots and is was really disgusting In the rooms the facilities were old fashion and needs renovation The room is small the breakfast was awful for the rate of the hotel The cleaning lady was cleaning the next room at 7 a m which I think is unacceptable The beds were not comfortable and there was a repair work early in the morning so we could nt sleep at all As we complained on the reception we were told it is not coming from our hotel but we saw the boys next to our room The airconditioner was not working properly the wifi connection was very bad We were really dissapoined At the end when we were leaving we asked for a taxi and with all the kids and the staff we were waiting the car for 50 minutes It was really a disappointed stay , Bulgaria ,3.8,0,0,Family

 We originally booked the hotel because of the location and being very close to South Kensington station The rooms are old and outdated and the hotel needs a bit of love and care When we booked we advised that we had a 1 year old baby and requested a cot On arrival we were given a room on the second floor While there is a lift to the first floor we then had to work our way up to the second about 10 stairs with a pram not ideal and should have been considered when organising us a room The hotel also has stairs into the lobby I can recall about 6 or 7 times that I walked into the hotel with the staff standing behind the desk and watching me struggle to get the pram and baby up the stairs Staff in general weren t overly helpful and really quite miserable Room was average but definitely not well thought out or planned small space under the bed but can t even fit a suitcase for example new showers in the bathroom but very little pressure I understand London is expensive and you don t get a lot for your money but I definitely expected a lot more I wouldn t stay here again , United Kingdom ,5.0,0,0,Family

 The problems were the hotel isn t kept very well the room and hallways had an unpleasent scent the bathroom really needs refurbishment bathtub fills with water and the electrical sockets for the TV were hanging off exposing wires Hardly ideal when you have a crawling baby I didn t think the breakfast lived up to expectation either given the prior reviews The two main lifts you cannot use if you have a buggy as they are too small So you have to use the lift for the garage and even that is incredibly tight for 2 adults and a baby , Switzerland ,4.6,0,0,Family

 Belligerent duty manager who tried to cover up and make excuses for lighting controls in rooms which just didn t work properly the cleanliness of the bathroom hairs in shower splats of something on tiles behind wc The same duty manager who told us lift to basement wasn t working and watched us struggle with baby in pushchair down stairs with two other young children only to be told by waitress there were no issues with lift so we used said lift for return journey An Indian themed restaurant where the prices were not cheap but the food was with a chicken Korma which didn t look like or taste like anything we had previously eaten in other restaurants and a supposedly madras style lamb which was literally lamb chops not marinated in the sauce but almost cooked separately with sauce then poured over to make the dish awful food but lovely decorated room More to say but running out of will power and not wishing to rant more than already Great location though and nice room once cleaned even with dodgey lighting controls and broken safe door with sharp edges , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Family

 A long list To start with 1 Family room is horribly designed with the single beds made out of iron and sharp curves hit kids often and not only kids even adults have to be careful see the hardly one leg space gap between the red chair and one single bed and the iron stands of bed ridiculous design 2 just next to the red chair is a table with sharp corners which also is dangerous for kids 3 absolulete non sense lighting system between the two rooms for family rooms This would mean you cannot switch off one room s any lights on its own So if kids want to keep their lights ON or parents need to keep lights ON no option to switch off any room lights on its own only 1 master light switch for both rooms which means if either of one room needs to sleep rest and other room needs lights ON then the one who wants to rest sleep need to do so with full beaming lights ON 4 staff is clueless and have one standard answer they say no one had ever problems till date so they cant help if our kids got hurt with the iron metal legs or sharp tables or hardly any distance between chairs and beds 5 room service attitude and reception staff attitude rude When room service waiter asked to boil baby milk bottle he advises us to do ourselves in bathroom using hot water Reception staff when requested for an hour late check out well in advance says we will be charged 10 euros per hour Reception staff arrogantly says goodnight to end the discussion whilst we are still talking When requested for free complimentary water bottle staff says you booked a room and didnt book a water bottle What a ridiculous answer Room service when asked to get some plates for kids dinner they say we will be charged 4 euros to deliver plain plates bcoz we are using their service else we have to come down and get it own Pathetic ready answers the whole staff needs to be trained in customer service skills for a 4 star hotel , United Kingdom ,2.5,0,0,Family

 We had several expectations that were all met within walking distance from Gare du Nord 15 minutes and it never felt unsafe close to a Metro stop one minute from Cadet near restaurants enough space for a family of four and quiet at night I had not stayed in Paris since my honeymoon 16 years ago so the modern feel and the relative size of the room and bathroom surprised me compared to my memories of the other hotel I had stayed at One nice touch was USB ports along the bed frame for charging phones Breakfast was included and had a good variety of hot and cold items and it was very filling My wife is a self described poor sleeper who wakes up at the slightest sound or if the mattress pillow is uncomfortable and she slept through both nights so that s got to be saying something Our room was by the elevator which we never heard at night and if there were occupants above or below us we didn t hear them The heating AC system was very modern and was quiet not like units that clunk on and off and whir loudly in a lot of American chain hotels I ve slept at The desk staff spoke English to varying degrees of course and were patient with my attempts to converse in French We were able to leave our luggage after checkout so that we could explore the city before our train departure at 6 00 P M The most unique feature was that we were sent a survey prior to check in to learn a little about us and ask whether we had any special needs or wishes i e suggestions of restaurants that served gluten free meals and the response was quick and detailed My wife and I have probably stayed in over 200 hotels between us for work and pleasure and have never gotten something like that We had a good feeling about the hotel from the beginning and it was a good experience until the end , United Kingdom ,10.0,1,1,Family
 The thing I liked the most is the service and the care of the staff As we stayed at the Sloane Square Hotel with my baby everyone was extremely attentive and friendly Also as our BA flight was delayed because of the global IT glitch and we missed our first night at the hotel the management offered us a very late check out exceptionally to compensate for British Airways fault And in addition to everything else when I realised that forgot something in the room upon my arrival home and called the hotel to check if they found the item they were extremely helpful Aude at the reception in particular and searched everywhere and found it Dear Sloane Square Jotel crew thank you very much for your hospitality I will definitely stay with you in future , United Kingdom ,10.0,1,1,Family

 Unfortunately there were numerous let downs at this hotel We had stayed there a year previously which was brilliant which is why we chose to go back however this time was a very different story I had called in advance to see if something could be arranged for my parents anniversary as a surprise for them however on arrival this hadn t been done and only one room I ll get to that next was ready we were there before the 2pm check in but as we had to be some place at that time I had called in advance to arrange an early check in The lady I spoke on the reception desk wasn t the friendliest or very helpful when I asked her about the rooms or mentioned my mum and dads anniversary surprise It seems that my phone calls in preparation for what should have been a special trip had fallen on deaf ears until I asked to speak to the manager at the time who then brought up much later on a small fruit plate bottle of wine and card The rooms were very dated and small I understand they have packed in as many as possible but the doors in and out of the room didn t fully open and only one person could walk around the bed or the room at a time as it was so small as well as being small the room was very dated and old fashioned We ordered food in the hotel bar as were in a rush at lunchtime and my dad couldn t go out and walk far to find a restaurant but once again since our trip in 2015 the food quality had slipped and wasn t half as tasty as what we had the previous year and their choice of juices as we weren t drinking at lunchtime were very limited Unfortunately after a very happy trip to this hotel in 2015 the standards have very much slipped and we were left disappointed , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Family

 Very ruth and unreliable staff Yana and her Manager especially Never settle to go to their basement rooms which they initially gave us with windows level overlooking to their indoor pool with no fresh air and constant noise Loud music and screaming people until 2 00AM from the bar every night of our stay 5nights when you have small child it was extremely difficult We were required to check in with receptionist every time when going back to our rooms if not our keys were not working Location is in bad neighborhood too far from the City We had to walk over 15 min one way to get to the subway Bus will take you forever We asked for hotel private taxi to go to Silverstone Grand Prix he never returned to pick us up in the rain and after waiting for 2 hours we had to look for another way to come back to the hotel about 100 miles away and of course our keys didn t work at 1 00AM So the hotel decides when you could enter your well paid rooms We ll NEVER go back to this place AGAIN , United States of America ,2.9,0,0,Family
 Their policy which allow children under 12 years old free of charge if stay in exiting bed but when I checked in they told me that the room that I booked can only stay 2 persons due to security reason They charged me more for EUR60 per night which I think it does not fair to me because I already followed the policy and did confirm it again through email but they still want to charge me by the stupid reason about security policy , Thailand ,2.5,0,0,Family

 I and my husband and my daughter stayed at the hotel from 30 March to 6 April 2016 when we arrived at night we have shocked when we see our room because it was very small and not suitable for us as a family with many luggage but the next day we talked to Mr Carlos Nogueira who is very cooperative smart and friendly he has changed our room to another one that was more comfortable and overlooking the street the location of the hotel is more than perfect you are in the middle of Ramblas street the most famous street in Barcelona and all the staff of the hotel are kind and friendly The only disadvantages is the Internet connection it was bad and disconnected a lot and the lift is very small , Saudi Arabia ,7.9,1,1,Family

 Hi I have recently come back from one of your hotel at park plaza Westminster As a loyal customer I like to mention that I was not happy with a few things which I encounted during my stay Firstly I would like to mention that as I arrived to the hotel our luggage was not offered to be taken into my room In camparison on my previous visit the doorman offered to take my luggage to the room Secondly as I entered to check in I mentioned clearly to the receptionist that I have booked 2 rooms for myself and my family however as I entered my room i realised they gave us the wrong room which was smaller in camparison to what I ordered Another issue which arose was that the lifts were not working and this had not been looked at Finally I would like to add that I had to ask 3 4 times to get a robe and slippers to my room , United Kingdom ,3.3,0,0,Family

 The staff was friendly and always helpful Large safe in room big enough for our laptops The breakfast was amazing the all you can eat espresso and mimosas was worth the stay You can eat a large breakfast and then not eat tapas until 2or 3 The hotel is right next to the beach but heat and sand can be tough for a toddler so we visited the pool more than the beach The pool is all one deepness Our toddler was the only one everyone else was adults so all the chairs were taken for sunbathers and no one was really in the pool We just waited until a chair became free The pool was quiet so we felt we had to keep our voices down The pool had a bar tender so the whole family enjoyed the pool The hotel is walking distance to the beach and beach restaurants It is also easy to get a taxi or jump on buses I wish there were more cafes around it but we walked down and found some It can be a little ghost town after 10pm but we stayed out until 12am yes with our toddler but it was completely safe We found Barcelona very child friendly with playgrounds almost in every block Instead of requesting expensive taxis to and from the airport because of car seats Take the aerobus It will drop you at the Plaza de Espanya Enjoy some of the cafes in that neighborhood and then get the H16 bus to the hotel Cheap and the busses have AC car seat problem solved , United States of America ,9.6,1,1,Family

 This hotel was a bit of a splurge for us so we were expecting it to be nicer than some of the other hotels we stayed at during our trip However this was our least favorite hotel of the trip and the most expensive For the price the rooms were very small and the beds were the most uncomfortable beds we had our entire trip They did not provide a blow dryer and our trash can was broken Both the room and the bathroom were uncomfortably small I purchased the executive room for my parents with a king bed and that is literally all you get for almost double the price Not worth it at all Also the staff was not very friendly Overall we were disappointed with the Grange Wellington , United States of America ,4.6,0,0,Family

 What they consider a Family Studio is a bad joke I ve stayed in single rooms in Tokyo that were significantly larger Just adding a cheap sofa bed to a small room does not make it a studio suitable for families I agreed with the front desk that they would at least close and open it every day as otherwise we could barely move around the room use the desk or open the refrigerator They failed to do so EVERY single day without our going to reception to complain and then wait a further half hour People were pleasant and apologized profusely but service is horrible The restaurant is also way too small for the volume of people with waits up to 15 20 minutes to seat for breakfast even with overflow to the lounge areas I learned an important lesson about putting too much faith in online reviews which seemed mostly positive I assume those will drop quickly once more guests share their experiences , Czech Republic ,3.8,0,0,Family

 If you are reading this I suspect that you are interested in booking this hotel If so I heed and plead you not my learned friend During my short stay 4 days 3 nights at this Hotel dei Cavalieri it has been a series of unfortunate events This can be witnessed by 4 events that my mother and I experienced throughout my stay 1 I should have seen the signs the very first moment I stepped into this hotel At the beginning of my trip despite being first in queue and told that my hotel room was still not cleaned yet my mother and I waited on the side A blonde lady served me whose name I sadly did not manage to catch because during the multiple times we exchanged conversations she failed to wear her tag This hotel staff told me that once they received a telephone call from the cleaners I could head to my room Subsequently an Italian family behind me was also told that their room was also not cleaned yet and they waited Thereafter once she received a telephone call the blonde lady gave the hotel key card to the bell boy to serve the Italian family whilst my mother and I were left at the lobby It was only after serving several guests that my mother asked for the blonde lady to kindly check if our room was ready Without any surprise considering she received the phone call a while back she finally handed us our key card 2 The second event would be during the provided breakfast I have not mentioned my ethnicity but I believe that it has something to do with the ill service that my mother and I received Both my mom and I are chinese When my mother and I went to sit at a three person table for breakfast we were blatantly told off that we could not do so However next to the table that we chose were two blonde ladies sitting at a four person table Once we pointed out that to the waiter and asked his reasoning for allowing them to do so but not us he quivered and finally let us sit down 3 , United Kingdom ,3.3,0,0,Family

 Unhelpful staff that chose to just see you struggle with luggages and baby strollers up the steps to the hotel reception and down the steps to the hotel exit door every day I was there for 5 days and no offer of help Front desk personnel was cold Imagine coming in from a 5 hr travel only to be told that you have to buy a bottle of mineral water as the hotel do not provide any complimentary water This is the first hotel that I know of within the same categories of hotel that does not provide a complimentary bottled mineral water in the room The checking out time is 12 noon and not even a slight extension till 1pm is allowed This I can understand and most of the time is due to in coming guests checking in at 2pm thus require the room but to be told that I have to pay for that hour of extension just reaffirmed my belief that service is last on this hotel s list , Singapore ,5.0,0,0,Family
 We had a weekend stop on the way home from camping in the south of france and chose this hotel because it had an underground car park and we had a car full of stuff a roof box and bikes It didn t go quite according to plan as the car park head height was only 1 9m so we had to take off the bikes AND the top box Luckily the super helpful staff found a big space in their storage room for us We particularly liked the swimming pool gym and the late checkout on Sunday 5pm because we had a family room The rooms are really nice with modern decor overlooking a small modern square next to the station We loved the glass screen between the bathroom and bedroom which turned translucent at the flick of a switch , United Kingdom ,10.0,1,1,Family
 Little extras made a big difference It was a hot day when we arrived to our room yet the staff had left a keycard in the slot so the air on continued to run had closed the curtains so the room was comfortable There were drinks not the normal water but fruit juices which the kids loved We were a towel short 1 evening 1 phone call to reception towels appeared at the door within 5 minutes The location is superb 5 minutes walk from Waterloo train station so easy access a stone throw from the London Eye the South Bank a bridge walk to either Westminster or Soho We were on the 13th floor we could have been in the country It was quiet no road or plane noise at all , Belgium ,10.0,1,1,Family

 I liked the everything comfortable room bathroom was large enough and had a bath separately with ocean salt The hotel offers 4 types of pillow which is really make comfortable your sleep The room is very clean and nice We had a room with balcony to Duomo Piazza The only problem is that the hotel does not have a restaurant and in order to have your breakfast you have to make order till 2 am They bring it to the room This creates a problem because you do not know what time you wake up next day in this case you have to plan your wake up You may also order in the morning but it takes 30 min to prepare and bring to your room Also the small table in the room is not comfortable to have a breakfast on it Therefore the next day I preferred to have a good coffee and some wonderful cakes and croissants at Crunchy Pastry near the hotel Bear in mind that hotel mostly has king size bedrooms and with only duvet cover it is not really comfortable if you sleep with child , Azerbaijan ,9.6,1,1,Family

 The elevator sucks big time After we arrived in this hotel we saw them working on it already but after few days it was terrible They should replace the elevator my sister got trapped inside and the bell was not working luckily she brought her phone with her and she called me up through Facebook messenger while she was inside it it took some time for them to get her out The room was not that clean I know if the place is dusty because I keep sneezing they didn t replace the sheets everyday The water pressure was very poor one of reason I like to stay in hotel because of water volume but that s not the case here in this hotel I choose this hotel for good review and well for the price but I should have stay in some well known hotel if I can turn back the time so problems like this won t be encountered by me I have a small baby and climbing to 4th floor in the stairs was hell The reception said sorry about it but not sincerely and according to him sometimes this kind of event will happen to anyone given it s gonna be but atleast the bell still working so someone can ask for help And seems like if someone will die inside they won t take accounts with it Upon arrival we were so tired to eat outside so I decided to order a pizza and they served us a pizza where it was still cold in the center We put a note and they gave me a note as well apologizing for it and box of chocolate That was sweet of them But they should be more professional enough to sell their services and products so the money paid in exchange will be well compensated If this will be the life in London oh well I won t dare to go back and if I do I will book in some reputable hotel where the percentage of this events will be so unlikely to happen , Philippines ,3.3,0,0,Family

 The hotel is vast with the size in order to feel like you are having a 4 experience the service and staff need to bridge the gap for customers to feel looked after having paid a premium This was not the case there was a conveyor belt mentality with staff at check in and hotels Knocking at the door even though Do not disturb signs were up both mornings not good with kids I had to request my mail copy of the bill over a week after check out, Ireland ,5.0,0,0,Family

 Hotel blocked GBP50 on my card on top of the full price for room without any notification or information in booking com system which I find breaching booking com rules The amount was released 2 days after check out which meant that during my London trip I couldn t spend part of my money Receptionist manager in the hotel couldn t find any immediate solution to that and behaved as it hadn t been any issue Is not about GBP50 but I may simply imagine that the hotel might have blocked GBP500 for same security reasons and in such condition I would be deprived of any money I had converted earlier to my GBP account before weekend trip It s just can t be trusted , Poland ,4.6,0,0,Family

 I arrived just after mid night and I was put in a noisy room where I could barely sleep due to the sound of machinery working it seemed to be the central air conditioning or electrical power generator There was a leak under the lavatory and the toilet was not the type I was expecting It may be ok for disable people but for me and the children it was not good at all because the floor was all wet when someone had a bath I asked to be changed and they couldn t offer another room promptly but they did it next day The second room had a far better toilet but it was still noisy and again as I just realized it around 1 am in the morning when the machinery become really louder I also couldn t sleep well on the second night It seemed to me that the staff didn t care about my claim I was so frustrated that I decided to move to other hotel When I asked to talk to the manager the receptionist told me the manager was not available but I noticed she was receiving instructions from someone she was consulting in the office I felt really bad treated that I wanted to leave the hotel as soon as I could My advice to other customers based on my experience avoid the first floor rooms I cannot speak about the rooms on other floors but make sure you check that you can cope with the machinery noise that can be really louder during the night And also I have some reserves about the managing team They didn t show any effort to understand and solve my problem Another problem the room telephones didn t work , United Kingdom ,3.3,0,0,Family

 Hotel is really run down for example there was water dripping from the ceiling in the corridor of our room Bathroom was not properly cleaned bunch of hairs from previous clients on the floor and in drawer Bed is extremely soft for us personally not comfortable Swimming pool chlorine way too strong and pool was anyway not really clean We ordered breakfast in the room the morning of our departure and they brought it up with 30 minutes delay And the very worst a gentleman that said that was a client came in into our kids room with his own room key His room key happened to be a master key that opened all hotel rooms We did not even receive a proper apology from the hotel for this issue To cut it short definitely not worth the money we spent for the stay and we believe this hotel should not be tagged as Gran Lujo nor 5 Star , Switzerland ,3.3,0,0,Family

 Plug sockets in room damaged previous guests toe nail clippings on floor Booked family suite but got given large double with no explanation Property advertises the need for lift from ground floor just past the bins for the Nando s underneath to the reception but the hotel layout means there are additional steps between that lift and any rooms Staff were curt but professional but unwelcoming Requested baby cot was given baby cot One of the rooms overlooks what seems to be a storage area and the extractor fan for the restaurant below if booking is try to avoid it All told it was not a nice experience and if I were to book again I d go with an Accor or Hilton property even at least they guarantee cleanliness , United Kingdom ,3.8,0,0,Family

 starting from the arrival at the hotel no guidance was provided on where we should get dropped off as the hotel is in a pedestrian lane The ideal solution would be for the hotel staff to speak with the taxi driver and provide them with the exact drop off location We had to walk 10 mins through lanes to find our way and it was not comfortable for first time visitors with children after having read stories of pick pocketers the check in area et is extremely slow as they are grossly understaffed House keeping is pathetic We were there for 6 nights they did not vaccume the room as sand was there for 2 days after we visited d the beach and the cleaning was sub standard A double bed had a single blanket and the blanket cover was provided separately for us to complete the needful a lot of noise in the room from the outside and light penetrating through the bathroom door they need door stoppers and people tend to bang the doors in the middle of the night which is very disturbing the hotel staff and least helpful in case you need any assistance with any tourist guidance some staff were helpful Christina who did put in an extra effort to help but overall the service experience was sub standard for a hotel rated as high on booking com the breakfast was average but there are a lot of cafes at La Ramblas after repeated complaints they included breakfast in our room package for 3 days but the customer service experience is frustrating when your on a holiday Lastly there is no security at the hotel Anyone can walk in and out of the hotel access the stairways and reach your room No checks and controls in place , United Arab Emirates ,3.3,0,0,Family

 Location location location first It is right off the famous Champs Elysee i e a minute away and a few steps to George V metro station which is directly connected to the bigger Charles De Gaule station which has the RER It is also close to a lot of very good restaurants and cafes including the famous Georges V with its tasty hot chocolate and desserts and shopping centers as Monoprix Zara H and M Sephora and great brands as Kenzo and Louis Vuitton The room size was good for a family of 3 We took the Executive room that had a queen sized bed that was comfortable in addition to a double sized sofa bed that can accomodate 2 We were shown the Junior suite which was bigger and had on top a small dinning table but it turned out to be a 100 euros more expensive per night and frankly did not think it was worth it especially since we were not planning to eat in the room The heating system worked very well which was a blessing since the temperature was around 1 C i e it was freezing The room had a very good sized closet an easy to use safe and a small fridge It had also a writing table and a chair and enough space for the lauggage The bathroom though was a little impractical since the toilette was in a separate room than the washing basin and the bathtub but the size was great and spacy and the magnifiying mirror was well located something of prime importance to me and my daughters to apply makeup easily The room lighting was good though it could be made better since you need to put each light on or off separately There was a little issue with the electricity sockets which were in impractical places and we had to go down to plug our phone chargers and i believe they should have been placed in a higher locations to give people easier access Also i realized unfortunately too late that the plugs located near the room entrance will shut down once the main corridor lamp is turned off i , Lebanon ,8.3,1,1,Family

 Loooong queue at check in An impression of hidden dirt Hotel looks more like a student rez In the dirty corridors there was a smell of cooking a bad smell rather then appetising Smelly mattress and pillows musty Soundproofing between rooms nonexistent as we had to listen to the couple next door copulating which for a family with young children was unacceptable My kids were asking me why was the man beating the woman and she was shouting You could also hear kids running up and down the corridors till midnight as the doors were also inadequate Breakfast was as if in a pigsty Everything was unhealthy and artificial juices cakes rotten fruit The hotel is set in a area with abandoned buildings railway lines and the view from the window was onto a construction site The neighbourhood was littered and dirty and far from anything and everything The entrance to the hotel from the parking lot is down steep stairs and no assistance to help with luggage or ramp It was funny to watch people struggling up these stairs with their luggage It is a joke that this hotel has 4 stars Someone should investigate it If you think that I must be exaggerating then spend a night there and , Poland ,2.9,0,0,Family

 It says that its no deposit when booking the hotel however they hold the first nights funds out of your account prior to your arrival I wasn t happy about this as I had booked three rooms for family and had the money held out of my account for all three rooms even though it is made out that you pay on arrival When i rang the hotel to find out why they had attempted to take the amount out three times I only knew because my bank had cancelled the transactions and froze my account believing it was fraudulent activity the woman I spoke told me it was standard procedure for all hotels I have never had this happen to me before when booking hotels Then she pointed out it was in smaller font at the very bottom of the page When i said this should really be made more clear she said i will pass the message on to the manager as your not the first to question the procedure Surely if its a problem you have been made aware of in the past you would sort it The bar area is really small and has one sofa then the most uncomfortable chairs imaginable No draught was available asked for a large wine only had small wine glasses so that was another no The room was basic very small but ok for a city break where you aren t in the room much Our stay was ok and in a nice area but we won t be returning to this hotel on our next trip , United Kingdom ,4.6,0,0,Family

 When we arrived for a late night check in we were told that we were being moved to one of its sister hotels 15 minutes away The boiler had broken in the hotel They did not call us in advance and advise us of this problem They also had us sign a paper committing us to full 4 night reservation prior to disclosing the facility s maintenance issues and being required to move We were then transported at 11 p m to the other hotel where we were told we had to pay for the full 4 night stay without inspection of the room or area At that hour we had no choice but to make the payment We were then stuck in a basement apartment and all of the attractions we planned to visit were a 20 minute rail ride away We asked to be moved to a higher level family room and they were unable to support the request We called booking com to express our concern but were only told that we were committed to the reservation and had to stay at one of these two hotels We then agreed to be moved back to original one with the preferred location Around 1 p m the next day we were moved back to the original hotel Although I was told by the hotel s management that the room was located on the 2nd level and was lovely and would comfortably hold a couple with an 11 year old child the room was tiny Much much smaller than most small European rooms Worse yet it was filthy dirty The carpet walls windowsills and pullout couch were obviously soiled The courtyard area where the room looked out on was filthy also with garbage laying outside We have pictures to support this description It was shocking that we were not released from the reservation We have used booking com in the past but NEVER AGAIN They should have helped us to find an appropriate hotel even if it cost us an additional investment , United States of America ,3.8,0,0,Family

 Booked the superior family room got put into a smaller room as our room wasnt ready we were not happy with this as we had paid for a larger room Staff then showed us the room that we had originally booked however this room stank of cigarette smoke I have asthma so it was not suitable for us to stay in there the lady that showed us the room said herself that it was not acceptable and that she wouldnt have stayed in that room either We then got put into another room and got told that there were no others available This room had awful views curtains hanging off the wall electric sockets coming off the wall the mini bar wasnt stocked crumbs on the floor from the previous occupants the ironing board was broken and the room was smaller than what we had originally booked and paid for Ruined the trip which was for my mums 60th birthday and her first time to London We will definitely not go back , United Kingdom ,4.6,0,0,Family
 This was an excellent hotel There is a Turkish hammam and small swimming pool which was a big hit with the kids The hotel is small but the staff are nice and friendly Especially Halim Thari and Nicolas The location is fantastic There are at least two superb patisseries down the road on Rue de Martyrs which provided outstanding breakfast We opted not to have the breakfast in the hotel because of this There is also a small Carrefour close by Loads of restaurants all around One can catch the Line 12 Metro at Place St George which is less than 200 mts away But other stations like Pigalle or Notre Dame de Lorette are also close Montmartre is just about a 10 minute walk All in all this was a great place and I will certainly consider staying here again It is not cheap but I felt that it provided excellent value for money There were four of us including my wife and two girls 7 and 11 The 11 year old had a separate single bed The hotel had provided another single inflatable bed for the 7 year old free of cost The room was spacious by European standards and the bathroom fittings and furnishings were of high standard The most fascinating thing were the windows with electrically operated shades They were very fancy As far as I could make out they were also sensitive to rain and close automatically if it rained All in all a great experience , New Zealand ,9.2,1,1,Family

 I booked this hotel 2 months before my arrival I saw that there is an option to bring one child under 16 years old with no extra cost the option is still mentioned on booking website I mentioned on the invitation that we are a family of 5 since we booked a room for 4 and I would like to use the option to have 3 kids using the existing bed set exactly what is mentioned on the hotel page on booking com We arrived on 2AM in the morning and the staff was not willing to give me a key unless I will pay for 1 extra room double cost I told them that the 2 kids are sleeping and they asked them to give me at least the key for the first room that I ve already paid just to send them to sleep and we can continue the conversation but they said no way and there is a clear message from the manager that I need to pay for extra room before I can use the first room I felt like a hostage and at the end I gave them my credit card just to be able to send my kids to sleep The staff also mentioned that they told booking that I cannot get a room and booking told them that it s OK BUT NO ONE informed me they both forgot the customer till now neither the hotel or booking provided me the name or time that they informed me about that I m still shocked from the bad service that I got from both the staff and manager that didn t have me any solution and just want my money on top of all that they room was prepaid and they didn t gave me any option for refund SUPER BAD service which made the overall experience bad , Israel ,4.6,0,0,Family

 As a longtime Booking com customer I have noticed that places are not always as good as the reviews lead one to believe however this place was so bad in every possible way I suspect the positive reviews cannot be true This motel is located in the middle of a sketchy neighborhood with nothing nearby I did not feel safe with my family Everything is 15 minutes away walking metro coffee a bite to eat everything The hotel is dark old and had an odor I could write in the dust on the top of the shelves One of our rooms smelled like sewage we complained to the front desk but the smell remained We overlooked the hotel back alley that was cluttered with junk and the staff was kind enough to wake us up talking loudly during their 6 30 am smoke break The beds looked normal until you sat on them several inches of mattress would suddenly disappear under the lightest compression I had back problems for weeks after the visit and had to visit a physician Unfortunately in the rush to leave with three small children we left our Amazon Kindle in the room We noticed it missing as soon as we got to the airport Called the hotel and explained the exact location where it would have fallen between the bed and wall and followed up with several detailed emails Of course the device was never found in the room This horrible experience does not even consider the fact that when my mother was in an accident and couldn t fly we had to fight to get the dates changed until after her recovery I understand no refunds but this should have been an easy exception and they kept the money for the additional day we did not use when we re booked It was just a horrible place all around Not only will I avoid the brand at all costs in the future but I now feel that I can no longer trust Booking com and I will not be using them in the future , United States of America ,2.9,0,0,Family
