 Not clean enough No baby bed Room too small, Saudi Arabia ,4.2,0,0,Family
 We were 3 families and had 3 rooms One of the bathrooms had a clogged shower drain which resulted in the bathroom getting flooded and unable to be used The staff was unapologetic rude and refused to change the room They kept saying they would send someone to fix it but refused to understand that the family living there could not use the shower before starting their day They just shrugged their shoulders and had no solution to the immediate problem at hand which was that the guests who had paid to stay in that room had nowhere to shower They used the showers in the other two rooms we had but we lost out on our morning because of the delay The hotel is located in a popular area and is probably always busy so they really don t care The hotel needs to take their maintenance more seriously to avoid such situations They must consider training their staff to deal with such situations if and when required The only good thing was that they had fixed the shower by the time we returned at night , United Arab Emirates ,4.6,0,0,Family
 Stayed 4 days with my family for the London Marathon Not a good experience The hotel is always crowded and not relaxing Rooms as soon as you enter in a small dark and narrow room near the door you find the bed In the middle there s a small bathroom and kitchenette and near the window another small room with a sofa additional bed Satellite TV always bad signal so you find all the channels available but it is almost impossible to watch a programme without freezing and video problems interruptions The first sign that you see whan you arrive tells that guests have to expect long queues for breakfast and it is true Queues for everything breakfast in the weekends check in elevators The queue for breakfast was the worst one considering that I was with my parents who had to wait 15 mins standing before sitting Inaccurate room cleaning One day room was made at 16 00 the next day they didn t refurbish toilet paper and soap The next one they didn t remove used glasses and dishes The first day they started to knock at the door for service at 8 in the morning with people still in the room Breakfast room cold and inadeguate for the dimensions of this huge hotel Staff not very professional and trained with some exceptions Location near Waterloo station in front of the hotel there is a bus parking so when you are outside waiting for a taxi it is always complicate Beside road works in the street so noise and long alternative routes to cross the street To find some bars Overall this hotel was a terrible choice , Italy ,4.6,0,0,Family
 Strange definition of city view we could only see the rails of waterloo station Poor breakfast service queuing for 45 minutes before gettting a table in a conference room Being obliged to watch children movie on a big screen while having breakfast Poor quality of food especially bread We had to call the reception every day to have a complete towel set , Belgium ,3.8,0,0,Family
 Everything else I booked an executive studio room and upgraded to city view the other week The stay was for myself and my parents I havent seen them in a long time and it was meant to be a family weekend out before I get married Firstly booking com has advertised the room I was booking with a picture of the room with a view to London Eye or Big Ben Did we get that view Not at all And we could barely get in the room as the sofa bed was so close to the door My mom is disabled so I went to the reception and told them that they must have gotten the room incorrect So they changed our room to a Junior Suite which just had a window overlooking the waterloo train station I have told one of the staff members that we upgraded on booking com and had to have a view to Big ben or London eye which they said is not their fault and theres the Shard building somewhere far away that we can slightly see and because the Shard is in the city this is the City view You can say that pretty much about anything I appreciate they changed our room to a bigger one until I realised that the Spa bookings I have made for myself and my mother have not been made Complained to the reception they said its not their fault again and they can try and fit one of us in at some point during our stay There were missing bulbs in pretty much every lamp in the room my moms duvet had a blood stain on have photo proof I have also requested to have an extra duvet as my parents dont like sharing one had to ask twice although it was written in the notes The next morning after the room was cleaned the extra duvet was gone again I have never had a worse stay in a hotel in my life , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Family

 Attitude of some of the reception staff particularly at check in Studio was smaller that I expected It came with a kitchenette but it was a squeeze to make a cup of coffee Also fridge space could just about accommodate a 2 litre milk bottle Not enough toiletries provided for a family of four Two tellies provided but acoustics made it impossible to use both at the same time There seemed to be a time lag and echo between the two sets Had to wait ages for sofa bed to be made up on the Friday and Saturday night Not good when trying to maintain a routine for young kids Steam room and sauna area needs to be cleaned more regularly Lots of hair lying about and robes were tiny Also black algae in our shower surround Had to repeatedly get key card reactivated Room was showing signs of wear and tear Faucet tap was loose Mirror was cracked Worst of all was the stench from the drains This was stifling some times usually at night , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Family

 location was terrible it is across the road from a city of tents of homeless people the room was like a sauna when asked if the air con was broken we were told the only use air con in summer the staff were the opposite of a rae of sunshine Especially one lady that was incapable of smiling I felt very unsafe here and chose to take taxis into Paris and to train stations instead of walking with my family even the taxi drivers would say oh that part of Paris is not very good , Australia ,4.2,0,0,Family
 Felt very deceived by this hotel booked a room at the grand royal to be contacted to be told we would have to move hotel we were being moved away from the original location that we booked the hotel did provide a taxi to take us to the new hotel but the room in this hotel grand Paddington court was a lot smaller and very cramped I would not of paid the price we did for the room if I had seen it before hand I feel this hotel is intentionally deceiving customers by allowing them to book the grand royal knowing that they will be moved on arrival would not recommend at all Bathroom was ridiculously small and the room was not suitable for a family of 3 Would never use this chain of hotels again, United Kingdom ,5.0,0,0,Family

 Not conveniently located from the airport or in to central Paris It is eother 20 in a taxi to central Paris or a 90 min walk The room was unbelievably small and It comfortable for three people in the family room I paid 150 for one night for a family room but it was not comfortable no small luxuries and not ideally located The fire alarm went off early in the morning which disrupted the breakfast routine We were dragged out of the hotel very early because a chef burnt some toast and set the alarm off From then on there was insufficient breakfast on the counter and it took us nearly an hour of waiting for toast and eggs to arrive Overall I was very disappointed with the hotel Please don t stay here , United Kingdom ,3.8,0,0,Family
 After a 40minute argument with the on duty desk manager at 12am Whilst our Children slept in reception we went to bed in a dirty room The room was not made up on either of the 2 days we stayed Bar lounge area is poor and staff were rude The look of the hotel and cost does not match the staff working there or the clientele it attracts Lots of drunk and disordly behavior , United Kingdom ,4.6,0,0,Family
 The room cost 285 and had no window At no point during the booking process was I told this When I complained to the staff they said I should have asked if I wanted a window as some of the rooms at this price have windows I said I generally assume that for 285 a room comes with a window and I should not need to ask for one I should be told if a room does not have a window during the booking process like I am with the low cost hotel providers in the city A bad start to a family holiday Utterly disgraceful hotel and staff giving my favourite city a bad name Travel to London but avoid this hotel , United Kingdom ,2.5,0,0,Family
 the room was very small and very basic the toilet and shower were squashed into a tiny space the bedroom was very small for even a family of 3 with no ironing facilities for 200 a night I would have expected a bigger room with better facilities it was probably on par with a travel lodge this was a surprise for my wife for our wedding anniversary and it was a total let down 4 stars 3 too many , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Family
 This was billed as a luxury property which was why we booked it for our birthday trip However it is all looks and no substance Price lists were to be found in bathroom by kettle etc and very little was included in the expensive price for the rooms Whoever thought the metal cups were a good look obviously didn t try to make a hot drink and then burn their hand on the metal handle no spoons just silly wooden stirrers Bin and sheets only changed every three days For a luxury hotel it offered little more than a premier inn at a fraction of the price Very disappointed not what we wanted for a special occasion , United Kingdom ,4.6,0,0,Family

 We booked a room for two adults and a four years old child Arrived and were told at the reception we had to book a different room because the law does not allow a child to sleep with us What The room was changed without additional charges but I suspect they chose the worst room in the hotel instead it was the first floor windows had bars and practically no light inside Outside was a dirty place with lots of garbage bottles wrappings and cigarette butts tons of them We decided not to have a look thru the windows as we were not going to stay in the hotel all time but after the first night we left It was really bad experience seemed the room was dirty and we felt uncomfortable then we waked up because of a smell of food it s likely some kitchen were under the room Never again , Sweden ,4.6,0,0,Family

 On our first night we noticed already that the bed they gave us is quite small for 2 persons I complained and requested to be transferred asap According to them they can not transfer us that same night because its impossible They were insistent that our room has a standard bed for 2 persons To prove my point I went to my parents room and measured it by hand I even took a picture to prove that ours was really smaller In the end they apologised and said that indeed that room we got on our first night had a smaller sized bed Yes we got transferred the following night in a room exactly the same as my parents but the damaged has been done We had back pains and did not sleep well , Philippines ,5.0,0,0,Family

 As regulars at this hotel we were highly embarrassed when we recently stayed with family at the hotel We had bragged that the hotel was a fantastic find which they were all going to love How wrong Rooms weren t allocated among our party correctly Far too expensive for size and standard of rooms Hotel needs a refurb rooms are shabby Breakfast wasn t to normal standard cheap produce We had mentioned it was my Mum s 50th and so they kindly left birthday chocolates in one of the rooms but it the wrong room Surely its the hotels job to know which guests are in which rooms We had hoped for views over the square like we normally have but only one room could see a glimpse And to top it off our bathroom floor flooded as the shower doesn t have a suitable draining system Considering we are regulars at the hotel and we booked well in advance I had expected a lot more We certainly would t even entertain the thought of staying here again Don t book keep looking there are far superior hotels in London , United Kingdom ,5.0,0,0,Family

 We arrived the hotel at the 3 30 pm and our room wasn t ready till after 5 pm We finally checked in after hours of waiting and very slow and poor service The club room is meant to be occupied by a family of 3 and we are here to stay for 8 nights The closet space in the room is ridiculous not even fitting for a single room Our clothes and belongings are scattered everywhere around the room for the lack of storage or closet availability The only closet available in the room is literally 1 5 meters wide with no drawers or shelves Our clothes are all in our luggage for the next 8 nights In addition to the fact that the closet is taken by the safe and the mini bar Service at the hotel is very slow and almost non existent Room was not prepared with enough towels in the bathroom and of course we had to wait hours for extra towels to be sent to the room There is no space whatsoever for our suitcases and as I mentioned we are a family staying together for 8 nights with a bunch of suitcases The pressure of the water in the shower is very week Employees at the front desk are not cooperative in any way to try and help solve our problem The quality of the room and service is far from what we expected to see at a 5 star hotel in the center of London We looked into checking out but unfortunately it is the holiday season and all hotels around are fully booked We are extremely dissatisfied with a very gloomy lifeless windowless very small club room in addition to very poor and far from 5 star quality service whether by employees at the reception housekeeping or the concierge Even after we finally got the room last night we had to wait for our luggage for an hour and we only got them when I went searching for them and was told they didn t know my room number to send the luggage up I hope you take my criticism to the hotel management as soon as possible , Egypt ,4.6,0,0,Family

 1 The service was sub standard After check in we had to find someone to help us take all of our luggage to our room they then took 30mins to bring our luggage to the room It was a huge distance between reception and the elevators of the west wing which we really didn t like as there was no easier access to our wing of the hotel 2 The room itself was terribly outdated The bathroom horrible with no shower only a step in bath A serious update is needed especially for the price you pay we didn t expect such old finishes poor quality of toilet bath 3 Our room was double booked whilst unpacking another family opened the door walked in Very poor management on the hotel s part Although they apologized for this afterwards through a simple phone call there was no compensation offered which another hotel would ve gladly done if they had made a similar mistake Given that the Hilton is such a huge hotel with over 1000 guests this kind of mistake is unacceptable because dealing with many guests at any given time should be their specialty It felt more like the staff couldn t handle the number of guests during our stay 4 We requested another room that had a shower rather given that my mother struggled to use a step in bath The room offered was much smaller only for 2 people but it had a step in shower which was the only reason we agreed to move but were told we would still be charged the same price for this new room as the family room we were previously booked into This to me is unacceptable given that the room was smaller not a family room 5 The breakfast situation was really unpleasant besides there being a very poor variety of foods drinks breakfast was served in the banquet hall because the usual restaurant which was much nicer could not accommodate so many guests , South Africa ,4.6,0,0,Family
 The room was the smallest room I have every stayed in The room was not clean The towels were not clean as I cut myself and the towel had blood on it and was just folded up and put back on the shelf for the next day The bath was never cleaned as it always had hair in it The lifts are the worst it took me 25 min one night to get a lift to my room The hotel had a convention on at the time so was extremely over crowded Couldn t use the bar couldn t use the cafe couldn t find any place to sit at all as the whole ground floor was taken over by the people from the convention This hotel is very expensive and way over priced for the service and facilities provided I stayed with my family for 12 days and half of us were in one side of the hotel and the others were in the other side of the hotel The hotel was unable to find 2 rooms together Would never stay at this hotel again , Australia ,4.2,0,0,Family

 on my arrival at 1 00 pm the room was not ready and we were told to wait until 2 00 pm this is in theory ok i know general check in rules at hotels but on the other hand this is my first time in life that i arrived at a hotel and couldn t get the keys so we dropped off our bags and went out we came back around 10 00 pm and received the keys from the reception once we enter the room it was horrible they gave us most probably the smallest room at the hotel that has no view at all i had booked an executive studio and the room we were given was not that after endless discussions they gave us another room which is more like an apartment nice view but very old fashioned furnitures but this overall experience was very much frustrating for us besides the rooms i saw have no similarity at all with the pics on the web site i have been to London many times and it was my first time in Victoria district i can say that there is nothing special around and all main London attractions are far away excluding Buckingham Palace the neighbourhood is not too bad but also nothing interesting last thing we wanted to heat the room a bit as we had a small child with us but the air conditioning was set to cooling only by the hotel , Turkey ,5.0,0,0,Family

 Oh boy Hotel is worn down full of families with kids breakfast area is so crowded that you may come to que for 20 minutes to get a seat location is far from tourist areas and the real Parisian atmosphere won t stay again here Before leaving the hotel my wife wanted to have a tea in the lobby the guy was so rude saying to her that he is not making any tea for 1 person he is busy and that she should go to any coffee shop in the neighbourhood for a croissant and a coffee We went straight to the shift manager who after listening to us promise to compensate us by refunding us the parking fee 47 which didn t happen not even now 3 weeks later you can judge by yourself btw entering the underground parking is really an achievement parking spaces are so narrow that only mini cars fit in just to be aware of but so is almost every parking in Paris , Germany ,4.6,0,0,Family
 As we was attending a concert for a special Christmas treat I asked if we could check in one hour earlier than 3pm we arrived at 2pm but was told the room was not ready and to wait while housekeeping cleaned the room We waited and waited and waited till just after 4pm This didn t give us any relaxing time and went straight to dinner at the pub next door as the restaurant was not open till later Before going to dinner we pre ordered a taxi to go to the O2 for 6pm At 6pm we went to the taxi area to be told the taxi wasn t there and will be around 30 40 minutes till it would be back and the hotel only has one taxi This was very stressful and we dod try to call our own but the other taxi ranks said it would take them about 30 minutes to come to the hotel Our taxi articed at 7 15pm After a very poor start to our Christmas treat once back in our hotel room with two children ready for bed the room was very very cold so tried to turn the thermostat up on the wall but the heating didnt work in our room It was 11 30pm and didn t want housekeeping coming to fix it at that time in the night so it was a very cold nights sleep , United Kingdom ,3.3,0,0,Family
 This hotel was terrible Avoid them This was the only place we regret staying at out of all the places we stayed on our 2 week trip They were unpleasant and overcharged us despite assuring us that we would be charged the advertised rate for the night we stayed and assuring us that a pre confirmed adjustment to staying 1 night was fine The hotel is poor quality and they are dishonest and unpleasant Avoid this hotel , Italy ,2.5,0,0,Family

 Arrived to find the room we booked was not available Needed 2 adjacent rooms given we had 2 adults and 2 children Hotel staff sent us to 2 different rooms that weren t adjacent and then finally the 3rd try was a success This took over an hour and everyone was really tired and frustrated No apology for the hassle from the hotel After asking if we could get a complimentary breakfast for the inconvenience there was little interest in anything of that kind Beds were uncomfortable Rooms were not serviced we were there for 2 nights Got a refill on the minibar water and soda only upon request Correct price was not captured at checkout Overall not a good experience I m sure under the right circumstances this could have been a good experience and staff going the extra mile to make us happy with our choice would have made the world of difference but they made no such attempts We certainly won t be coming back , Iceland ,5.0,0,0,Family

 The housekeeping staff the one we came across at least was rather rude We needed a baby cot and there was one in the room when we arrived but it was broken Then we called the housekeeping and the one of the house keeping staff female who came to replace it she tried to convince us that it was not broken Then when the room attendant decided to replace it she brought as girl s cot and in a way although we mentioned that our baby was a boy we had to put the baby for the duration of the stay in a girls cot Apart from the housekeeping room attendants the other staff at the reception were really polite and nice Concerning the size of rooms and hotel facilities these were really small Lift very very small can only fit three people or one person with a baby pram Reception area extremely small and when people have luggage a the the space become even more squashy Standard room really really small Fitness facilities such as a pool steam bath etc which are mentioned in the website we were informed by the reception staff that hotel customers can use the fitness facilities of other partner hotels in the area this means that information on the hotel website are misleading potential customers Overall we feel that this hotel is the worst by far option of a hotel for booking your holidays , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Family

 This place was a disappointment The space is tiny and the floor was very dirty They need to deep clean the floors When my family arrived the toilet was broken throughout our stay They had people coming to fix it but it never worked Even with the toilet not working they did not discount me anything The staff there told me that I will receive a receipt at 2pm the same day through my email but I have never received any receipt When I came home I checked my credit card and it turns out they charged me 4 extra transactions a few days after I have already arrived home When I contacted them regarding the receipt and the extra transactions they took more than a day to reply and told me that they discounted me for the toilet by charging me less city tax and there was no mention of extra charges This didn t make sense because they charged me for the hotel and city tax separately The city tax was paid in full so overall it ended up costing me more than what I originally booked on here I tried to contact them again because I do not understand why they are charging me even after my stay when I did not touch any of there stuff And its not even small charges They were about 300 euros for each charge Are you kidding me They still haven t reply about it so I had to call my bank to deal with this matter I am very unhappy with this place and would not reccommend anyone to stay here This is definitely not a 4 star hotel Please take my advice and save yourself the trouble , United States of America ,2.9,0,0,Family

 I stayed at this 4 Star Hotel for 3 nights in May 2017 There was 7 of us so we had 4 rooms one being a junior suite My room was 550 for the stay Firstly I d like to say that this is NOT a 4 star hotel It s dated dirty over priced and the service is poor in every area The rooms are OKAY Basic a bit ugly and dated it felt like they were rushed to be finished bad painting jobs wonky canvases etc etc but there is a good size TV a wardrobe with a safe a mini fridge etc The beds are quite comfortable but the air conditioning is AWFUL and the cleaning service was quite poor The bathroom in particular didn t feel clean at all and it smelt a bit funny too one day we were left without towels and toilet paper My parents had the junior suite room which was NOT a suite Any suite room usually provides 2 rooms or areas a bedroom and an area with a sofa and a TV the only difference in the suites is that they are a bit bigger They also had terrible issues with the heat in their room and described it as dirty and uncomfortable Over 700 for 3 nights The reception and restaurant inside is okay Quite dated and a bit cheap worn but the pool area is nice and there s a large and very pleasant seating area for food and drinks outside One night we had some tapas from the restaurant which wasn t great pretty sure it was all bought frozen stuff but the cocktails were pretty yummy 10 each We also had breakfast every day at 15 per person per day it was quite nice but not really what you would expect for 15 Good bread some mini pastries meats eggs bacon yogurts etc but bad coffee from a hospital waiting room kind of machine , United Kingdom ,3.8,0,0,Family
 There was nothing 4 star about this place When we arrived there wasn t a soul at the reception floor no help was given with the luggage and the floors windows were dirty But that s nothing compared to the family room we were given for us and our 2 children Each time you opened or closed the bathroom door the whole lot of planks on the bathroom ceiling went up fell back down due to the change in the pressure making a huge noise similar to that of a building collapsing To top that up the noisy bathroom fan never went off the whole night There was mould around the shower and you could smell the damp throughout the room There was no duvet instead there was a very old blanket in between the sheets When we asked for the manager a girl whose outfit looked no better than the duvets with creased trousers and worn off shoes no make up came to the room She said we would ve sent the technical team to the room during the night We then spoke to the general manager who offered only to take 40 Euros off the 200 we had paid Breakfast was no different from the rest of the service We can cancelled our second night and left for another hotel with the 2 kids This place should be shut as it s not managed properly at all , United Kingdom ,2.9,0,0,Family
 I was a little bit disappointed with this hotel if I m honest I read lots of reviews on the net but when we arrived we had a massive stain facing our room on the carpet which was slowly approaching our room We told reception about this problem but nothing was done until our last day Also a strong smell of cigarette smoke was lingering outside our room for the whole duration of our stay again we spoke to reception about this and they just said ok we travelled with our baby daughter and that was the concern regarding the smoke smell I was also looking forward to using the sauna and steam facilities but they were both out of order I stayed in January I had the feeling because it was out of season the hotel wasn t up to the standards it probably would be in the summer months , United Kingdom ,4.6,0,0,Family

 I have read good reviews on this hotel on Booking com so I decided to make a reservation for family room for my trip to Milan at the start of my holidays 1 night and at the end of my holidays 2 nights The first time me and my family arrived we received two connected rooms with 2 bathrooms HOWEVER the second time we arrived around 2 weeks later despite booking the exact same room same price at the same time with the first time we received a COMPLETELY different room The room we received the second time is very small with a king sized bed and a SOFA bed yes I repeat A SOFA BED for a 4 stars hotel really I went down to talk to the receptionist who claimed that she is a hotel manager She has claimed that the first time was a upgrade we were not inform about that AT ALL She has also excused that it could be because her English was not perfect hence the reason why we could not understand her My family and I were left extremely disappointed and unhappy with this unacceptably inconsistent service and staff explanation We will not come back to this hotel ever again, Italy ,2.5,0,0,Family

 When I come into the room I was very upset because they gave me standard double room with extra bed even though I made a reservation for family junior suite room When I checked in they confirmed the room was same that I reserved They cheated on me and without any apologies they continued to make an excuse and all of sudden they showed another room which was totally different room and I refused Their execuse was very ridiculous and I felt very angry Finally they gave me broader room saying that this is largest one in this hotel I did not largest one I just wanted the room I reserved for my Xmas holiday with my family If you make reservation with Family Junior Suite Room you must check room and their face which it tell you truth or not In the same evening I couldn t sleep at all but no more claim cause it was Christmas and there were three receptionist Andrea Victoria and one lady who gave me the lie with false smile , Greece ,3.8,0,0,Family
 Due to uncontrollable flights changes in our schedule months prior to our vacation we no longer needed our hotel in Milan because we would be flying out of Rome However even though we tried for months to cancel the reservation or credit it to a future stay at another location the Best Western absolutely refused to work with us and refused to refund our money or give us a credit We had to put a dispute in with our credit card company which is still being sorted out now I would never recommend staying at any Best Western if this is their attitude towards Customer Satisfaction , United States of America ,2.5,0,0,Family

 Some of the staff are too arrogant and neither helpful nor available They gave us an itching smoke smelly room and blamed it on us even looking that we were travelling with a baby They woke us up by mistake at 4 30 am on the night we had the discussion about the smoky bedroom The automatic lights seem fancy but not working After complaining again in the morning things got slightly better Not a good experience at all and not even close for the money you pay for The restaurant was way too expensive for Barcelona prices and took long for them to explain me the final bill They could not tell what was coming from the bar and what from the restaurant No way this hotel can be voted as the best as they claim It was a definitely a bad experience , Switzerland ,3.8,0,0,Family

 Booking com is more crap then the hotel I was shown a hot tub bed room at the point of sale on booking com website though was given completly poor quality basic room When i asked for the same room was told have to pay 3 x more Hence make sure you are not booking this hotel only because of an eye catching room picture shown on the booking com WE could not use the pool as it was cold we were told it never heats up until June The cleaner took my night cloths which i couldnt recover and no one could tell me where they were The place is too far from the town hence taxi is 15 trip to the town if you are landing at BCN airport its other end of the city hence 45 each trip Breakfast was good though 17pp very expensive I would never recomend using booking com and this hotel to anyone , United Kingdom ,2.5,0,0,Family

 Location this hotel brings the definition in the middle of nowhere to a whole new level Food a chef that serves some undefined frozen fish but with a bite of frozen lobster along with over roasted unpeeled baby carrots and an undefined something that could be anything between a splint of driftwood and a used vanilla pod into a broth heavily polluted with cream and a cracker on the side and call this bouillabaisse is capable of anything I d suggest crossing the road and get some better food at the Burger King Cleanliness poor Carpet shower walls everything gave that feeling I do not want to touch anything here nor walk bare feet Totally unexpected I have to admit Rooms self pretentious illogical tiny uncomfortable just name it The shower cabinet in the center of the room is just a very very bad idea perhaps more suitable for one of those places that offer hourly rates plus there is not a single little surface at hand height to place your own shampoo or shower gel bottle and in order to close and open the stream of water you have to bring the selector through the Cold position which is not nice if there is no room to set aside Toilet no privacy whatsoever the enclosure does not close properly let alone locking and if you are sitting for the big thing every few minutes you must waive enthusiastically toward the movement sensor unless you want to complete the operation in the dark Sink more or less the size of a soup plate and placed at the end of the room desk mind your elbow Panoramic view of Amsterdam if you like to see how a KFC restaurant looks like from above search no further this is the hotel for ya I ve never noticed that they look like fried chicken buckets thanks Fletcher , France ,2.9,0,0,Family
 Beware of making reservations in this hotel via internet bookingcom as there is a risk you will not get the room you reserved as it happened with me and my family The explanation of the front desk attendant was that the hotel provides the best rooms in category to their regular guests who books rooms directly by phone or e mail all others who use internet will get the worst rooms In spite of a fact that we stayed in the hotel twice before at the beginning we were proposed a room in the other part of the hotel which definitely needs renovation and looks very poor for the money hotel was going to charge us after our refusal to stay in it the front desk man suggested we leave the hotel and go somewhere else to look for accommodation Finally he proposed a room in the main building but it was smaller than the one we booked though the cost was the same Moreover the attitude and overall behavior of the front desk attendant was very rude and unacceptable for a hotel which is 4 stars rated , Russia ,3.8,0,0,Family
