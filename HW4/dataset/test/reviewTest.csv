 The staff here are indifferent and the hotel didn t respond to communication in the lead up to my stay I arrived 4 hours prior to check in time and had emailed twice in the week leading up to staying to ask for an early check in even offering to pay for it after a 30 hour journey from Australia I didn t receive a response and my room was not ready until 2 hours after their advertised check in time I was offered a toilet off reception to use to change and told they would store my bags The toilet floor was covered in urine It was a disgusting and disappointing start to my trip that coloured my view of the hotel , Australia ,4.2,0,0,Business
 The hotel operators are cheats liars and thieves I booked a Double and even after calling them on the night of my check in to say that I was checking in late there was NO room for me when I showed up at midnight There was also a family with a toddler asleep on the couch in their lobby who had experienced the same thing They moved me down the street into a SINGLE and then were totally unreasonable about offering me a discounted rate refund on the lousy room BOOO Don t just walk run away from these crooks , United States of America ,2.5,0,0,Business

 Restaurant is dual purpose Good menu in the evening and very professionally run by the staff Breakfast very ordinary I am afraid Food from the cooked options cold Toaster both of them are not user friendly especially when there are children using them Tried the option of ordering breakfast next day as per the options Eggs Benedictine were excellent as was the restaurant service , United Kingdom ,3.3,0,0,Business
 The staff were all friendly However I was shoked the room was so dusty everywhere even the tables and i have kids with me I think they should take care about the cleaning part because it is the most important thing The key card for the room was not working well everytime we had to get in and we had to call the reception for fixing it Also most important channels in the TV Were not working and there is no looby as far as I noticed Also we had a late check in at 3 30pm on the arrival date , Kuwait ,5.0,0,0,Family
 The place was nothing like the picture on the website We requested a crib for our baby and they gave us a baby playard and a blanket After they put it together we didn t fit The room was underground no view the heat didn t work and the bed uncomfortable I didn t even bother complaining since it was only one night but I regret not spending 20 more Ando going to a better place , Guatemala ,5.0,0,0,Family
 Lock on bedroom door was broken Exterior bedroom doors were filthy and everywhere looked like it was in need of a good clean redecoration and some tlc At checkin we were told we d been upgraded to a family suite The room was depressing and when we asked reception tif we could see the room we d booked we were advised that there weren t any available The upgrade was clearly a con We d have been much more understanding if we d been told the truth from the outset The family suite was a major disappointment dingy with dirty marked walls and carpet that looked grubby and threadbare around the edges Hotel was run down inside and not at all like the internet photos The bar was unfriendly and uninviting as was the furniture It lacked atmosphere and the carpet was filthy especially around the Windows The beds were comfortable but not sure why we had two single beds when we d requested a double When we mentioned the door lock to reception to be fair they removed my 5 00 beer tab from the bill My wife did not drink her unchilled glass of white wine and the rather surly barman reluctantly didn t charge for it which was appreciated No restaurant or room service We were very disappointed as nothing about this hotel felt or looked 4 Staff were pleasant enough , United States of America ,5.0,0,0,Business
 They claimed they had a boiler problem and hence could not honour the booking They said they will provide rooms at another hotel which was their sister concern also called Grand Royale and equally good but sent us off to Shaftesbury Hotel where we were asked to share one room for three persons for the first night The second night we were transferred to two rooms but they were so tiny we could not even open our suitcases plus there were awkward steps to get in and out of the room That hotel did not even have a restaurant except for breakfast After much complaining we were given a better room but nowhere near the rooms shown for the Grand Royale It appears that the Grand Royale London Hyde Park is used to attract bookings on booking sites and then people are sent off to a much lower standard hotel In my opinion they are confidence tricksters One guest had evened called the police when we were there in the lobby for the same reason The hotel was not shut as other guests were given and stayed in rooms Since I was with family and had a lot of luggage we had to lump it as it was already night They killed the joy and ruined our holiday , India ,5.0,0,0,Family
 Checked in with family around 7 30pm Given room keys for a 1st floor room Upon entering room there was no sofa bed for kids Had to go back to reception and queue again to be seen where I was first advised that I had not booked family room Upon showing the booking ref where it did show the family room was booked we were given a new room on 7th floor Upon moving from the 1st floor to the 7th floor the keys didn t open the door so had to leave the family in the corridor go back to reception again queue again to get new keys Upon entry to the room the sofa bed was not made up so had to wait for house keeping to arrive to make up The whole check in period from first entering reception to actually getting everything sorted in the room approx 40mins which isn t good at the end of a long day when you have tired kids After all this turned on the TV and the remote control didn t work At this point gave up and went to sleep P S You have to pay extra to use the hotels own services i e swimming pool , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Family

 Do not stay if 1 You have luggage there is no place for your car to stop on the road and our request for someone to help us with the luggage up the stairs was ignored Your car will have to park opposite the hotel in a side road and you will have to push your luggage across a busy road and thronging sidewalks whereupon you then have the further privilege of carrying luggage up the stairs on your own Request for assistance will be ignored Same applies when you check out 2 You have children who watch television the television channels do not work They did offer to change us to a room with working television channels if extra amounts were paid 3 You watch the news for the same reasons cited above Television is an extra cost that you have to pay for 4 Travel with companions only one set of towels was provided despite a family booking A request for extra sets was met with a direction to look in the cupboard We found one extra set therein which after our hunt was still insufficient 5 You want a normal bed beds were set on wheels and moved away from the headboard as the night passed I would have liked to give a score of zero if possible , Singapore ,2.9,0,0,Family

 There were lots of mice running about in the bar dining area When reported to the member of staff he laughed it off as if it wasn t an issue I then reported it to the lady in reception when I was checking out She apologised and said she would report it to her manager She thanked me for bringing it to her attention and said they were unaware of the problem I told her they were aware of the problem has there were reviews on trip advisor that mentioned the mice She then became a little embarrassed and wished me a good day I left and won t be returning , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Business

 Finding yourself in a room with one window that overlooks the indoor swimming pool where a large number of children are understandably playing noisily and where there is no mobile phone signal is not what I expect for a business booking Then to be advised that there are no alternative rooms but later a different view is given to booking com and I am accused of requesting an upgrade that i had never asked for And when seeking to cancel and get a refund that was refused That wasn t a great experience , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Business

 1 The receptionists are not professionals One day before the checkout I have asked the night shift receptionist to proceed with the payment for the reservation The told me that the payment has been taken through booking website At the time of checkout the morning shift receptionist told me that the payment has not been done yet He refused to contact booking com to make sure He kept insisting on paying the reservation regardless to what I told him Then he has been trying to join the night shift receptionist by telephone Finally the night shift receptionist had responded He claimed that it was a pre authorisation He did not apologise about this mistake I think that the night shift receptionist was not in wood to work so he had fabricated the story of the payment The funny thing is the morning shift receptionist kept saying it is not the problem of the receptionist he did not apologise about the behaviour of his colleague and he refused to give his family name I asked to join the manager he also refused 2 There was no place in the hotel to leave the bagages for a coupel of hours after the checkout because the available room to keep the lagauges was full of covers and blankets 3 The receptionists do not give a damn to whom enter the hotel even at night time So it does not seem secured , United Kingdom ,4.6,0,0,Business
 Nevertheless there are number of things that can be improved and not all will have an impact on their profitability 1 Internet in the room has to be paid Most of the hotels include this in the daily rate and even if I paid once for the service I had several problem of connection actually money wasted 2 Water in the room 1 or 2 500 ml bottles is a normal practice in good hotels 3 Flexible breakfast arrangement allowing the guest to have a breakfast whenever she he wants is to me a better arrangement than obliging to commit all days of the reservation 4 The room service was not efficient and in 2 occasion I had to remind the reception of doing the room In one instance they forgot to do the room and then in the afternoon was too late I also asked twice to have the shampoo and shower gel In both occasion they forgot to supply the material 5 The telephone in the room is not designed to make national and international calls so basically this hotel is not good for business trip when conf call are needed 6 After 7 days having paid a fair amount I have asked for a late check in I had to pay GBP10 for each late hour Although I got a GBP10 discount to be honest most of the hotels has given me this for free I have never paid a penny for a late check out 7 When in the hotel restaurants I had to pay straight away rather than paying the difference at the check out Very disappointing to order coffee lunch and whatever else and be always with a credit card or cash to pay the balance immediately 8 Breakfast not a good selection of food Croissants and ham were really bad 9 To access the swimming pool and or the gym there is an entrance fee if I did not misunderstand again most other hotels offer this service for free 10 The bed was with thin mattress and during the night I could feel the springs jumping and making strange noise Not very comfortable , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Business
 The room via booking com was awful drab and smelt of cigarette smoke and puts me off using booking com in future It was clearly the cheapest worst and most depressing room they had on offer I asked to be moved it was that bad which they did The next room was better but still disappointing and below par as compared to the wonderful reviews high rating and glossy hotel photos Although the hotel was a bit further out than I wanted I thought it would be worth it as I was hoping for a special romantic weekend with my partner before my work trip began This was all VERY disappointing The toilet then got blocked the next day so we had to be moved at which point they did upgrade us to a room which did look like the photos on display This was the type of room I expected in the first place and I did not appreciate the rigamarole to get it I will not be staying there again in future and am very apprehensive to use booking com which I have used faithfully for many years , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Business

 Size of the room was just perfect for a small child with no luggage The room was impossibly tiny and hotel staff couldn t move me Not as advertised by Booking com and definitely not worth the rate paid No room to even use the teeny tiny desk in the corner which was a major problem because I was on a work trip The shower didn t drain The TV didn t work well would randomly turn off over and over The bed was fairly uncomfortable and even a bit unstable and rickety Though they were nice the hotel staff gave me some bad information about getting a VAT refund which wasted my time You can t get a VAT refund for hotel bills and the concierge staff should have known that The staff also didn t seem to know if breakfast was included or not Hotel was advertised as having shuttle service from airport which was false They had room service but there was nowhere to eat the meal except on the bed and no place to put the tray , Israel ,4.2,0,0,Business

 The impressions made by the website arrival into the lobby public areas set you up for high expectations Unfortunately it falls flat once you head upstairs The corridors are dark dusty despite a hoover being left in the corridor with the cables all over the floor causing a porential trip hazzard Further disappointed in the bedroom a small box with a platform bed surrounded on 3 sides by walls glass up one end no space to walk around so you have to clamber up over the bed the way it is set up there is only one bedside light No windows to open you have to keep the blinds curtains down for privacy causing more of a claustrophobic feeling The shower unit is more like a steam room as soon as you take a shower causing the toilet paper towels to become damp cold water dripping from the roof On top of this the room had not been dusted properly with dust on the glass shelves mirror The room was not at all inviting or enticing to stay in no matter how much gadgetry there is Oh check your docking station when cleaning the room so that the iPad is charged enough to operate the room facilities , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Business

 1 I was leaving the hotel about 07 00 am on 23th of April 2016 There was only one person at the reception There was a line and I was in a hurry Only after 07 00 arrived some additional staff They turned on computers It took a while when they started to work Everything was done in a very slow pace I asked them why there was only one person at the reception and why they arrived so late But I received quite unpolite response that there was a change of a shift And no apologies at all 2 I was making some short video on my old phone for my family on a lobby of the hotel when security guy touched my shoulder in a quite rude way and told me that making video is prohibited by rules of the hotel It was so ridiculous like I was making video in a secret military property Only after speaking to a manager they allowed me to do some video , Canada ,4.2,0,0,Business

 Upon arrival you will be asked to pre authorise your credit card with an extra amount on top for alleged expenses that you might incur even though there is no minibar in the room This is a nonsense as the hotel has your credit card details and is protected in any event If you do not agree they will not register the check in Reception staff were in don t care it s just my job mode This is a surprising policy for a supposedly higher level hotel It is far from a welcome to treat the guests as if they are potentially bad debtors In the interior it is a throwback to how offices looked in London in the 1980s The bed although described as a King Size bed was too narrow for two persons Sound insulation is non existent so you will have plenty of chance to hear lovers making love lovers making war children crying and the cleaning ladies cleaning Aircon is a noisy ancient system that continues for 40 minutes after you switch it off but you will need it to stave off the chilblains There was a table stand only on one side of the bed Normal practice would be to have one on each side As a final bit of context I have never before given a negative review and have stayed in hundreds of hotels but St Paul s Club Quarters will not get another visit , United Kingdom ,3.3,0,0,Business

 I booked this hotel for a few people who were on a business trip and the comments on their return would not make me want to book with that hotel again It was very date drab and not particularly clean The rooms were extremely small and cramped one lady couldn t even open the door all the way because the bed was there One person was told they weren t upgraded to one of the better rooms which was what the lady was in and was taken out of the building and along the road to another building This is not the sort of hotel that I would book for a business trip so consider it was not value for money I would definitely not recommend it The website does not show the hotel in it s true light so is very misleading , United Kingdom ,3.8,0,0,Business

 This was booked as business trip for a colleague using a company credit card and booked through the booking com website As far as i was aware everything was paid for as you took all the payment details during the booking as I wanted to pay for it The person staying then told me the room was not paid for as he arrived which is VERY embarrassing and he had to use his card to secure the room Then on Saturday morning I receive an email NOT even a phone call to advise me that i had to complete a spreadsheet and send photos of the card used for the booking otherwise the person staying would be charged to their card I was at home and the card was at the office so i didn t have access to it I then had to send photographs of my own card to the reception at Holiday Inn and pay for it personally suffering credit card charges because of this absolutely outrageous situation AS you can imagine in this day and age having to send images of my credit card to someone was not exactly ideal as i have no idea who the hell these people were I have had to call reception of the hotel and get told this is some new policy I will categorically be not using Holiday Inn EVER again and have no idea what on earth bookings com think they are playing at , France ,2.5,0,0,Business
 The hotel was oversold and our room had been given away so we were put in a partially constructed room with loose wiring hanging from the wall We had reserved a room for our family of three but got only one double bed There was no soap The temperature was too high and there was no way to turn it down because the loose wiring was what should have gone to the thermostat The front desk congratulated us on getting a newly refurbished deluxe room It did not seem like they were trying to be ironic We did get moved to a normal room on the second day , United States of America ,3.3,0,0,Family
 I specifically booked two twins On Booking com a few hotels will allow you to specifically book two twins When we got there they gave us one double I frequently travel with my daughter and girlfriends and will only book hotels that will allow specific singles booking If I had known this request would not been honoured I would have never booked it Further it appears hotels have the option to not allow specific twin bookings After being offered a king bed instead in the interests of making it right and while desperately trying to rebook a hotel room at 6 pm on a Saturday night in the west end of London whilst holding show tickets for 7 30 and letting them know I was unimpressed I was offered two separate rooms and moved to a room with twins the next day That room directly faces a very active new construction site with jackhammering etc starting at 0800 On checkout I was asked if I was happy with my stay I said no At this point the concierge pointed out they had given me two rooms for the first night He continued to argue the point I should have been happy Sorry I had a simple request two beds I did not want to have to panic on Saturday night or move on Sunday I did not need the stress at the end of a multiple hotel stay vacation to deal with this I did not want to be next to a construction site Even at check in before offering two rooms the check in staff argued with me about the booking process and needing to phone and confirm This is the age of computers You know how many twin rooms you have Don t sell what you don t have Amend your parameters on booking com Advertise you are located next to an active construction site , Canada ,4.2,0,0,Family

 During my stay my grand mother 85 years old she was ill and we had a phone from our country and heard that she is in a very bad situation so we changed our airplane and we kindly would like to ask the reception and we would like to talk with the manager that could we make one day early check in we were 8 person and 3 rooms because booking com customer relation talked us to speak with the manager I am 38 years old and I travel all over the world belive me I have never seen such a BAD AND RUDE staff in my life Yes I also know that the room is not returnable but because of CUSTOMER RESPECT we do it in our country the manager should come and talk with the customer Even the hotel manager oblige to talk with us and never come Her His room is 1 meter to the reception People shouldnt forget that You should respect the customer because we are the one who pay your salary The rooms are very very small Even in Paris and very dark view no sun is coming to the room Additionally a bad smell is coming from the toilets and never lost They are telling that the breakfast is buffet it is something joke there is only egg and cheese that is all for breakfast The lady in front of the desk Has glasses and I think she is in 50 s she is the rudest people I have ever seen She should be the only reason that NOT TO stay in this hotel if you are visiting Paris with your children or older persons and can not use Metro Subway I dont suggest you to stay here because it is far away to Every important attractions Neither in the booking comments it writes it is very close to the city center and good location it is not true For example because of my small children 3 and 8 years we all have to use the taxis and the closeses touristic area is something 15 euro with taxi such as concorde square 15 euro louve musuem 25 euro , Turkey ,2.5,0,0,Family
 I stayed here for a recent short business trip to London for 3 nights prior to a vacation in Europe On the second night I was itching but couldn t pin down the cause Well night 3 I woke up to a bed bug in the bed I took a picture of the bug and decided to see if there were more which I found on the mattress along the headboard something I had read about where they like to hide I complained to the front desk and showed them the pictures They dealt with it by being apologetic and offering me a free breakfast management said they d need to get a report from the pest control before any further action was taken I believe in giving people a fair chance to rectify the situation which unfortunately wasn t the case in this instance Instead of following up promptly I had to email them and ask whether the report was filed I also had the huge inconvenience of having to launder all my clothes and spray out my suitcase on vacation for fear that the bugs got in there Not only did they confirm that yes in fact they did find LIVE bed bugs but basically that they can t identify the cause and basically insinuated that it could ve been my fault I was absolutely appalled by the treatment and lack of customer service No fault to the front desk staff but how management dealt with this was appalling , United States of America ,2.9,0,0,Business
 I booked this for my wife who was traveling on her own first time in London I went for a better quality hotel thinking that the service and hotel would be very accommodating ohh I was so wrong I set the booking as a late check in and as my wife got there at 11pm due to traveling long distance When my wife at the hotel very tired and wanting to sleep and rest the hotel reception would not allow her to check in as she did not have my credit card when I booked through booking com I said that I would not be traveling and I was booking it on her behalf I asked to speak with the reception team as my wife is a foreign to try to explain the situation reception declined and was trying to chuck my wife out of the hotel and treat her like a tramp of the street I rang the booking desk and a man said there was noting I could do unless I paid again so with my wife now crying I had to transfer money to her account so she could get a room so now I have paid twice something I was not happy about reception said to my wife I could call the manager tomorrow that s very helpful After 30 minutes of waiting on hold to speak to booking Com apparently the only person who could sort this mess was them I spoke to a nice man that rang the hotel and then they said the had refunded me and could take 48 hrs still no money and they had upgraded her if the room was a upgrade I would of loved to see the first room a ground basement floor room not only this but when I booked I asked that I did not want ground floor as I wanted upper floor for better safety for a single women on her own I have worked in hotels for over twenty years and single woman are always put on upper floors This is one of the worst experience I have ever had to deal with my wife some distance away and me at home looking after my young children worrying if my wife will be on the streets of London all night , United Kingdom ,4.2,0,0,Business

 The room wasn t really a room more like a cupboard The door couldn t open properly because the furniture a bed a chair and a desk that had been crammed into the cupboard in a desperate attempt to make it pass as a room took up the entire floor space There was no space for me to put down my bag other than on the chair and that left nowhere for me to sit or stand other than on the bed I felt quite literally like I was a child hiding in a store room meanwhile the hotel staff told me there was no way to change rooms Having already paid for my two night stay I felt compelled to make the most out of it but I should have just left I slept reasonably well but slipped into depression the claustrophobia anxiety that I didn t have adequate accommodation when I was supposed to be enjoying myself in town and lack of self worth to be accepting a cupboard as my dwelling added up to an oppressive wall of negative feelings surely only ordinarily experienced by the homeless I bit the bullet and paid for a second hotel after the first night I simply left and never went back My advice to others is to pay a few extra pounds at a hotel where you actually get a room instead of being crammed into a storage space like a pile of unwanted linen , Switzerland ,2.5,0,0,Business

 Extremely disappointed with my stay Firstly I was rung midmorning of my arrival date to be told I was being relocated to another property then after an hour of phone calls en route whilst on the train to London found I could in fact stay at the hotel despite the maintenance issues that were occurring having had to press for this information firmly and repeatedly I also had to ask for an address and name of the hotel as I could not find it on google worrying to say the least and a little stressful Booking com were not very helpful either I d booked this hotel months ago and of course it would be impossible in London to find an alternative accommodation in the vicinity I required at just under 80 for the night Perviously they have been great On arrival I was put in a room which could have been considered a closet with a window onto an industrial vent The heat was unbearable and after calling down to reception and growing impatient hailing some porters I saw in the hallway still running late to get to the business event purpose of my trip I was moved to another room and due to time restrains had to just agree to it The furniture was in a deplorable state broken and chipped the shower was dirty with orange scum on the grout and limescale on the head the mirror was cracked down the middle but at least this room had a window albeit onto the back of other properties and having to open and close doors of he wardrobe bathroom to navigate to it Later I asked to book a taxi and only on almost arriving at my destination the firm they d used not knowing how to get there I was on the gps on my phone was charged a fare that was 6 more than the going rate for a hackney cab something I thought I was ordering instead of a private firm Apparently this rate had been agreed prior to my departure why they didn t tell me this I have no idea , United Kingdom ,3.8,0,0,Business

 The hotel doesn t respect the terms and conditions described at booking com as they imposed me to pay for an extra room cause we were two adults and two young little children although my kids were under the age that is allowed to stay for free as quoted below Free All children under 2 years stay free of charge for children s cots cribs Free All children under 12 years stay free of charge for extra beds and that s what i did exactly i booked a room and asked for an extra bed but when arrived at the hotel the answer was sorry we can t accommodate you in one room but when i said that is as per your terms and conditions when i booked the room they told me that those condition are not applicable any more when i asked to see the responsible person he didn t want to even walk out of his office which is a very very very bad attitude from the top person of the hotel so imagine the rest of the staff although also i had a loyalty member ship with this brand of hotels also this didn t give me and advantage I would like to also request booking com to review the T C s so people wont get in a situation like the one the that I ve been through Please post every word i said , Libya ,4.6,0,0,Family
 I didn t like that the hotel had a failure of their HVAC during a record heat wave I didn t like that their only option for relief was one of five fans available for the entire hotel Obviously I wasn t one of the lucky or quick ones and had to endure a room that was 84 degrees That may have been ok if I could open my window to let air in I did and until nearly 4 in the morning got to listen to the dance clubs and drunks from the massive station across the street One of my colleagues while enduring the opressive heat also woke up to ants crawling on him in his bed The hotel management refused to speak to our group and the rest of the staff was terribly rude I also didn t like the fact that staff kept telling us the air was fixed when 84 degrees on the top floor of the hotel clearly proved it wasn t Lastly having to change hotels in the middle of my trip doesn t rank at the top of things I like about this terrible hotel My advice if you re looking for a place to stay where staff treats you as a guest and not as if they re extending you a great privilege by letting you have a room go elsewhere , United States of America ,2.5,0,0,Business

 To tell th truth the hotel is not worth living in it kindly speaking My colleagues have arrived on a business trip with the expectations to work in the hotel as the hotel says that wifi works properly but my colleagues had no possibilities to work there as this wi fi was extremely slow in all public areas But this is not the only problem The air conditioning in the room did not work as it shoul and that s why it was extremely cold in the room do you imagine the situation when you arrive exhausted after work and are afraid of catching the cold beacause you can not turn off the air conditioning And then you see that the ventilation aperture was plugged with dust and dirt which is very bad for health And one more problem the window curtains were awfully dirty That s not the condiotions which could be offered by the 4star hotel The rooms we have booked should have been 18 but in fact they were too small and my colleagues didn t even have possibility to place their luggage In addition to all these problems there is no lobby in the hotel and as the consequence no place to work in Also there are no sockets to plug in a standard European plug neither there is a plug adopters we could borrow at the reception The 4 hotel in London shouldn t have this kind of problems We highly do not recommend this hotel and looking forward for the refund because the money we have paid do not correspond to the level of the service of the hotel , Ukraine ,2.5,0,0,Business
 There were several issues but the main problem was a non friendly staff member who had completely ruined our staying experience Already at the night of the check in we were requested to pay for the entire stay which was surprising as I had always been paying at the check out Eventually we agreed that I d pay for the first night paid cash and the rest on the day after He issued us our key cards and we went to our room The next evening I approached the front desk to pay for the rest of the stay where the same guy was on shift while my wife with our toddler went to the room since the kid desperately needed a bathroom I completed the transaction and headed to the room when the clerk indifferently said oh by the way your key is not valid anymore let me issue you a new one In the meanwhile my wife had stumbled upon a locked door and ran back downstairs to find some other toilet They actually locked us outside our room with our luggage inside without any prior warning while we weren t short on the rent Any attempt to complain were responded by the dry cliche Sorry this is our policy If that wasn t enough when I returned back home I found out that they actually charged my credit card for the entire stay without omitting the first night which was already paid in cash while the amount on the receipt was the correct one In addition 1 The room was heading to the main road which was noisy since it s on a bus route and there was a flickering light on the building next to it which prevented us from opening both the blinds and the windows during the night 2 During one of the nights around 3am the fire alarm went off extremely loudly for at least 15 minutes hell on earth with a confused and panicked toddler and staff without any answers 3 The maid lady was leaving the new towels toilet papers and soaps on out bed instead of the bathroom Any requests to the front desk about it didn t assist 4 , Israel ,4.6,0,0,Family
 We booked room for 3 people 2 adults and 1 child 15yr old with double bed and sofa bed but got double room with the small folding bed that was located right in the middle of the small room and almost touching the floor After long discussion about difference between sofa bed and folding bed at the reception we got offered second single room for our daughter for one night with the promise that we will get proper room for 3 of us on the second night Despite the change of room for second night Room was not appropriate for 3 people it was so small that we barely had room to navigate through the room Pictures on the site that advertise the rooms are not corresponding the reality Money charged are not reflected in the room facility and service The only positive is a location Very disappointed and the trip overall was ruined by the all room booking and movements from one room to another Also it would be good to notified customer that they have to pay full price at the check in and also that hotel will take at the check in 10 deposit for the room equipment , Ireland ,4.2,0,0,Family

 We would never stay again Lots of bad things about this place We ordered room service on the evening we arrived hoping to eat and get out to see some of Vienna We requested hot water to heat the kids food to be brought before and were told no problem it would be straight away Over an hour later nothing Eventually after calling again the food arrived and was a disgrace The 14 burgers were burnt both of them someone had scrapped the burnt parts from the bun and put them back on the plate Despite taking over an hour when we were promised 25 minutes the food was burnt but cold We complained and weren t offered a replacement The attitude was that we wouldn t be charged but no apology or offer of prompt replacement so asked to speak to a manager It was over 24 hours before a manager got back to us we had to call twice more and in the end the response was to leave an apple and a small box of chocolates in the room as an apology Too little and too late In addition the room was small and was not cleaned to a good standard We found hairs in the beds and on the towels that were not ours The sink in the bathrooms blocked The shower alternated between very hot and very cold Overall a terrible stay and very poor standard for the price , Ireland ,3.3,0,0,Family

 I booked this hotel for my two very senior colleagues on a business trip because it was close to the bullet train station the office they were visiting It seemed bigger than the average size a 4 stars hotel and had good reviews After the first night they asked me to move them to another hotel as there were all kinds of small but inconvenient issues the air con appeared to be working but the room was not getting any cooler shower had low pressure the room seemed a bit outdated breakfast wasn t nice etc I had two rooms booked for 4 days one of them a suite I asked the hotel to cancel the other 3 nights and keep one night as cancelation fee that s the policy if you cancel less than 24 hours before the stay and on booking com it appeared that it can be cancelld anytime if you pay one night Print screen attached They refused saying we can check out but pay the remaining 3 nights for each of the rooms I sent emails to Booking com with print screen of the reservation that seems to show this cancelation policy they did not have ANY answer They just encouraged me to take photos of the room so we can convince the hotel that the room is inappropiate I can t really take photos of shower pressure and temperature My boss who was actually staying at the hotel had business meetings all day and didn t want to interact with them so he asked me his PA to negotiate with the hotel I made the booking from my account I handle all his travelling arrangements especially abroad outside Japan The hotel refused the request because the person actually staying in the room did not report directly despite telling them many times through the Booking com customer center that I m their assistant who made the booking the people actually staying don t have the available time foreign language ability disponibility to negotiate with them , Japan ,3.8,0,0,Business

 Always out of items on the breakfast menu One morning they had no sausages and I was told it was a 30 minute wait for fresh ones the following morning they had no beans at all completely out The tables were slow to be cleaned and prepared for the next guest I had to find the cleanest table I could find and on three occasions I had to ask for fresh cutlery They put me in a room in the same corridor as a coachload of screaming school kids then I returned on the Monday to find the cleaner had emptied my room and moved everything into a room on the next floor obviously going into my bags in the process as things like my phone charger had been out inside my bag The room they moved me to had an air lock in the radiator and was constantly clicking quite loudly in the dead of the night which interrupted my sleep for the rest of the week At times the car park is difficult to get parked in until the bar empties I doubt I will stay here again this was not a good experience which is disappointing from a best western hotel as they are usually very good , United Kingdom ,5.0,0,0,Business

 Six of us travelled for business purposes due to this purpose we booked 3 Twin Guest rooms However 2 of the rooms were actually double rooms On complaining of this one room was switched to a double room which was fine however our room we went downstairs to amend our room and were given our new keys hauling our suitcases with us The set of keys we were given were incorrect so we had to go back to reception and get another set again hauling suitcases around The gentleman behind reception didn t apologise and blamed the computer We then went to our new room with two twin beds The room was a disabled room so we had red string hanging everywhere and a seat in the shower with a very unappealing grimy shower curtain It was very inappropriate giving us a disabled room on a business trip especially when the twin rooms were booked well in advance Later that evening we ordered some beer and a pizza to celebrate the closing of our business deal I specifically asked the gentleman who took my order to bring the beers straight up I even rang again to remind him as it was taking so long He then brought the pizza which was very undercooked and looked like a child had put it together which wasn t eaten due to the poor cooking and the beers that we no longer really wanted because we had waited so long On going down the breakfast in the morning at around 10 05 breakfast was absolutely freezing Paying 15 for a breakfast that is ice cold was ridiculous also on getting a glass of apple juice I noticed that my glass had lots of dirt floating around in the bottom So 15 was paid for basically a bite of bacon Really really unhappy and absolutely furious at the overall experience I usually enjoy my stays at the Hilton but definitely not this time We were not even asked if we could have any sort of discount the staff really just did not care , United Kingdom ,2.5,0,0,Business

 This hotel is rated as 4 star but should be 2 star or less Terrible choice and I feel some part deceived as I paid somewhere north of EUR 180 for the night there I do not recommend this hotel Here are some points 1 My room was not clean or at least it felt and looked unclean There were coins on the floor when I arrived and they stayed there the whole trip 2 Towels in the bathroom had dirt spots on them they were also worn and torn The bathroom had a large window in the shower towards the street and beneath the window there was a rusty radiator it did not add to the hygiene level of the room 3 Lights were hanging loose on the fasteners above the bed I was just waiting to get them falling in my head 4 The air condition unit started some loud drumming at 100 decibels or could be even more in the mid night Not able to sleep I complained but the hotel was fully booked and nothing the staff could do When the radiator finally got quiet I ensured it was off for the rest of the stay 5 The bed was a foam rubber mattress far too soft for any regular sized 80 kg weight man to sleep in 6 There was not an option to ask for privacy as no placards signs were available to hang on the door 7 No coffee or any beverages available in the room 8 The TV had only regular TV broadcast stations in bad quality with bad pixels no cable or any HD broadcasting not that I would have enjoyed it in the soft foam mattress bed in the unclean room This hotel is rated as 4 star but that is extremely overrated in my opinion Should be closer to 2 star or even less , Iceland ,3.3,0,0,Business

 The arrival at the hotel was really poor The receptionist was much more interested in chatting to the young girls who had come into the hotel asking for directions than they were checking us in to the hotel the girls were not customers guest The junior suites we were due to stay is was best described as truly horrendous no daylight no view a ridiculously small wardrobe and a crazy bad layout of bathroom When we returned to the section to complain about the junior suite the staff were disinterested in our feedback about the junior suite they were not friendly nor were they accomodating We had said we were so displeased with the junior suite that we should move to another hotel The hotel staff said nothing could be done as the hotel was full We went and spoke to two other guests who arrived as we were checking in and who also had a junior suite We took great comfort that they ALSO thought the junior suite was horrendous and that the staff unhelpful They told guys they were to be moved to another room the next day Returning to reception they then agreed to move us to another room the next day Upon reflection I wish we had moved to another hotel Our trip involved a return to the city for 4 further days on the return leg of our trip and decided not to stay here as I would not consider this hotel nor its unhelpful staff again Undoubtedly the hotel will make all sorts of excuses but plain and simple the hotel does not represent value for money and I would not recommend it , United Kingdom ,3.3,0,0,Business

 Reception staff were generally disinterested on check in and out Room was too small for family of four to share We paid extra for hotel with pool but when we went to use it at 4pm it was shut for private party later that day When I asked why we hadn t been informed the receptionists response was that he hadn t been told either So two very disappointed children and an unnecessary expense the rest of the weekend was raining though obvs not hotel s fault Not good enough for a hotel that charges this much to rely on location alone , United Kingdom ,4.6,0,0,Family

 The family room was not laid out particularly well for instance all four of us slept in the same room but there were two very hard double beds We have one boy and girl who had to share a bed not very young children so this was an issue When asked at the reception if they has any mattress toppers or way of making the beds more comfortable we were told no They could not help or offer any assistance An expensive room for the comfort level provided Breakfast was also very expensive at 19 euros pppn 76 euros for breakfast I think not So we ate breakfast at one of the many local places for approx 24 euros for all four of us No onsite restaurant for an evening meal if we did not want to venture out , United Kingdom ,5.0,0,0,Family
 I booked myself and my three staff for a relaxing massage and mirning in the spa After our massages we went Fuentes to enjoy the pool sauna jacuzzi and sauna but were unable to do so due to screaming crying babies having swimming lessons mothers singing nursery rhymes and generally total chaos It was the most unpleasant disappointing experience in a hotel I will never stay there again despite the fantastic location to the excel where we were exhibitors Management were poor in their emai response stating that baby swimming lessons were displayed on their website If find is a total fob off and poor customer service For this reason I will refuce my entire hotel rating to zero out of ten The sign as you walk into the spa on the wall attached does not live up to its promise Also a general service charge of 12 5 is added to the bill in the Resturant I asked a waiter if the tips were split fairly and was third they all get split at the end of the month The previous month the waiter received 100 in total I refused to pay the service and tipped in cash How disgraceful to keep tips from your staff , Jersey ,4.6,0,0,Business
 First of all the hotel is an area that the night is very dangerous to walk Unfortunately the hotel s personel does not do nothing to control the area around Almost I get robbed just one step before the entrance in the hotel so I started running to avoid the incident The hotel personel are extrimely rude and are not willing to assist I payed 10 euros for a glass of water and a coke I payed two nights although I stayed for only one night Reservation made with booking com with 100 cancelation fee however the hotel personel were not willing to discuss the problem or give me a discount When I enter the room I found a dirty baby bed left from the previous coustomer , Greece ,3.3,0,0,Business
 This was my second business trip to this hotel in one month I stayed a total of 10 days on two business trips in the Club Room level of the Hotel and I will not be going back The first night at the hotel was a disaster The noise was so bad from the Air conditioning units outside that I had to change my room three times To give the hotel some credit they did try hard to resolve the problem but the issue is the hotel itself rather than the personnel working there This hotel needs an upgrade especially the Double Glazing There is absolutely no soundproofing at this hotel and all the noise from outside can be heard in the room I was there with two other work colleagues who all complained of the same issue One of my colleagues who stayed on the other side of the Hotel said that he could hear the Train literally passing in Stereo through his room all night We all went to our conferences very tired and agitated The crazy thing about this experience was that we stayed in the Club Room level of the Hotel These were supposed to be some of the best rooms in the Hotel The other thing I noticed was the beds do not have fitted Bed sheets covering the matress They just use Flat sheets which means that in the morning you are often lying on top of the mattress with half a sheet under you This cannot be hyginic and is not something that I have seen in other hotels The bed was also very hard and uncomfortable Certainly not what you would expect from this standard of Hotel As part of my job I spend at least 2 weeks of every month travelling around Europe and unfortunately I have to give this hotel 4 10 , Spain ,4.6,0,0,Business

 I was with my mom this time and when we reached the hotel after a long flight I asked them to see the room before paying the full amount to ensure that we will get a good room but they refused they said that we have to pay fully When we went to the room the room seemed to be very small and narrow and I my aim in this vacation is to let my mom feels comfortable and enjoying everything and the room was really too small so I had to go down again and I asked them to show me a better room as before I booked a room with the same category but it was much bigger than this So they showed me another room with the same category but it was better than that room The thing is that in this room the cabinets was near the toilets and not like the previous room when the cabinets were near the bed and there was no space for us to move So from the beginning they had to give us a good room as they saw me with my mom and at least they had to think about doing their best to let her feel comfortable in the room, United Arab Emirates ,7.5,1,1,Family

 Overall this was a great hotel fantastic value and we would definitely stay here again but if you really want a family room book adjoining rooms We visited Barcelona right before Christmas with our 3 and 6 year olds We stayed in a family room 1411 which seemed like a normal double room with a smallish pullout sofa The main bed was very comfortable and the blackout shades kept the room dark Breakfast was good with scrambled eggs fritatas sausage bacon pastries cereal yogurt fruit meats and cheese but the same everyday VERY few hotels we looked at in Barcelona had breakfast included so this was a big bonus It is located about 5 6 minutes walk from a metro that takes you straight downtown Buy a 10 trip card for 10 Euro rather than pay 2 40 per trip There is a mall across the street with a big grocery store and some standard shops like Zara and H M but nothing special There looked like a couple fast food places but little else for food in the area Taxis were fairly cheap and there were always 2 or 3 right outside it was about 8 Euro to Sagrada Familia and 35 Euro to the airport We looked at a lot of hotels in the downtown area but all seemed risky for either quality or noise in this price range This was modern clean comfortable and convenient all at a great price , United States of America ,9.2,1,1,Family

 Our experience completely exceeded expectations Last time we were in Barcelona we stayed at Hotel Arts but frankly enjoyed our experience at Olivia Balmes more We went to the Arts for lunch a couple of times during this trip and this reinforced our opinion that it could be much more pleasant to stay in a good centrally located 4 star hotel with warm staff than a big impersonal luxury resort We travelled as a group of 8 and reserved 3 different types of rooms double triple and suite and were very pleased with all of them They were all spacious and bright and clean Everyone at the hotel bent over backwards to be friendly and helpful As we arrived well before check in time we waited in the restaurant and had beer and coffee Upon requesting a bill we were told that those were our complimentary welcome drinks Later one member of the group had a minor health issue and needed to see a doctor The lady at the front desk couldn t have been more helpful She walked the guest to a nearby clinic and translated his ailment to the doctor who promptly and effectively dealt with the issue Although the hotel is centrally located it still exuded a sense of calm The entrance is very well appointed indeed there is space for cars to load and drop off and there is a taxi bay right across the street This will be our go to hotel in Barcelona We enjoyed hospitality at its best and at very reasonable prices with no nickeling and diming , United Kingdom ,9.6,1,1,Family

 This hotel has opened almost 3 months ago and here it is on top of all hotels in Milan and there is more than enough reasons for it actually from our stay here we decided to lookup Room Mate as the first option wherever we go hoping this will be a chain standard This is still growing chain hailing from Spain and is currently expanding internationally best of luck guys and keep it up I even looked up some of their other hotels and they are towards the top in each city I looked up The reason for the raving reviews is very simple they put their selves in the travellers shoes and acted accordingly whatever pains you when staying at a hotel is not here like Spacious rooms we had a triple room with double king size bed and single bed and still the room felt spacious at par with some 5 tar hotels electrical outlets conveniently placed very well lit spacious bathroom with two basins and both a bathtub and a big walk in shower with rain forest head toiletries that you are happy to use breakfast till noon free wifi is not only in premises but you can ask for the free wifi portable router to take it with you on the go with free 100 mbs everyday throughout your stay a storage room if you need to leave your luggage or as we did keep the baby stroller there instead of taking it up to the room everyday staff are remarkable in every aspect special thanks go to Piero Francesco Andrea Hany Hassan and Sara for making every encounter more pleasant than the one before and taking all measures to make us feel at home If you look up the address via Google Earth you will not find the hotel as the street was photographed while Giulia was under construction so the hotel is the construction work you find when zooming in to street level till google updates the photo this is an amazing location at the door of the hotel you re a couple of steps to the left to Duomo and another couple of steps to the right to Vittorio Emmanuelle gallery Duomo metro is , Egypt ,10.0,1,1,Family

 5 hours before the opening of the check in time the hotel declined my cards whitout any reason it was the first time I had to face that kind of problem despite I ve always joined hotels with booking com for long time After checking with my bank I could verify there was nothing wrong with my cards and bank accounts so I had to call custumer service of booking com in order to be reassured on my booking in such a situation I learned the hotel must let the booked room available if you check in by 6 pm Once arrived at the hotel I had to wait 30 minutes to have the room It was a bunker room without any window room 8 so I asked to have a different room room 2 that was near the hotel s kitchen with an old window overlooking on stairs leading down to some tin bins The room was nothing special and quite small I joined better rooms in different 4 stars hotels in the U K Considering the high volume of 4 stars hotels available in Lodnon my advice is that there are better hotels definitely , United Kingdom ,5.0,0,0,Business

 The hotel was covered with scaffold The air conditioning didn t work and it was impossible to open windows because of the work dust on the scaffold I refused to stay in the little first bedroom that they proposed me which was on the back side of the hotel It was all dark with black protective covers and no air con Un trou rats They nicely proposed me an another room with more light on the street side but still far from confortable as it was mentioned on your booking site I would have like to be aware of the renovating work of the hotel so I would have not stay there As a French i believe it doesn t give a good image of French hotels for foreigners and I don t think it is what WE need all at the moment I have been using booking hotel website for years but I don t know if I will use it in the future because booking agencies should be aware of everything about the hotels they sell , France ,4.6,0,0,Business
